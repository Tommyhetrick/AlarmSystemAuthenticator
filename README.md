# AlarmSystemAuthenticator

This is a small authenticator program for [my alarm system](https://github.com/Tommyhetrick/AlarmSystem)

All this program does is open a local express server and waits for a GET request from the alarm and then closes.

I would suggest just grabbing the exe from Releases unless you want to modify the port it uses

**Dependencies:**
* [Express](https://expressjs.com)
